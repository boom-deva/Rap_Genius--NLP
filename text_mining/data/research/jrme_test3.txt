In this chapter I engage in a complementary analysis, with a focus on a particular discourse structure that enables some of the classroom work to be done. Why focus on classroom discourse? Classroom discourse has become an im- portant site of inquiry and change in mathematics education (Lampert & Blunk, 1998; NCTM, 2000; Kieran, Forman, & Sfard, 2003). As students endeavor to make sense of mathematics, their talk and interaction in the classroom provide an important resource for the construction of meaning (Cazden, 2001; O'Connor, 1998). Cazden (2001) describes classroom discourse as comprising a crucial part of the "social plane" in which higher order thinking first appears before it be- comes appropriated by individuals. Argumentation has an especially important role in mathematical thinking (Lakatos, 1976; Lampert, 1990). If students are to engage in authentic mathemati- cal activity while making sense of the subject, then argumentation and disagree- ments should find a way into the discursive practices of mathematics classrooms. In discussion-intensive classrooms, students can be, in a sense, apprenticed to ar- gumentation and reasoning practices through their participation in the classroom (Lave & Wenger, 1991). However, as teachers of discussion-intensive classrooms relate (Lampert, Rittenhouse, & Crumbaugh, 1996), such disagreements come with the social risk of losing face (Renkema, 1993) in front of peers. A question thus arises: How can classroom discourse be organized to support mathematical disagreements that (a) are intellectually productive, and (b) minimize social discomfort? In everyday interaction, disagreements are viewed negatively. Understanding how teachers support productive intellectual disagreements in classroom conversations is thus worthy of examination. The data provided for this volume are ideal for investigating the foregoing ques- tions. During the class session of January 19, 1990, Ball's students generate ap. [97] 98 Accountable Argumentation "new" class of numbers while arguing vigorously about the nature of odd and even numbers. Ball manages to support the children's engagement in this activ- ity while maintaining the social equilibrium of the classroom.' The class session is thus an exemplary instance of mathematical argumentation that preserves the intellectual community of the classroom. This chapter focuses on describing the interactional organization of account- able argumentation, an activity embedded in whole-class discussions in Ball's classroom. An analysis of the classroom's interactional organization can foster insight into how this particular discussion managed to be intellectually productive without disrupting the equilibrium of the classroom. Organization of Chapter This chapter is organized in the following manner. First, I locate this analysis theoretically, tracing its connections to analyses of both classroom-participation structures and the discourse of disagreements. In the second part of the chapter, I explicate the classroom's interactional organization by describing a participa- tion structure, which I call accountable argumentation, that supports mathemati- cal learning through disagreement. I then analyze two disagreement episodes to illustrate accountable argumentation in action. Finally, I conclude with a discus- sion of accountable argumentation as a pedagogical and analytical resource for investigating mathematical teaching and learning. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES Participation Structures A helpful approach in understanding how the class co-constructed the odd- and-even numbers during the session is to examine the classroom discourse prac- tices. Classroom discourse practices are socially developed, patterned ways of using language, gestures, and representations, coordinated with understandings about the subject matter (Greeno, Benke, Engle, Lachapelle, & Wiebe, 1998). One analytic construct used to understand those patterned interactions is that of classroom participation structures (Philips, 1983/1993). Participation structures are interactionally emergent, providing and organizing resources for learning (Hanks, 1991). Participation structures allocate student involvement in class- room activities and produce a level of interactional organization within which the structuring of any single encounter is accomplished (Philips, 1983/1993, p. 79; see also Herrenkohl & Guerra, 1998). The structure, however, is highly contingent; its rules provide resources for participants to play the game accord- ing to their own strategies and are not simply obeyed (Lemke, 1990 p. 9). Some 1 Please see Posner (2007/this volume, pp. 127-172) for another interpretation of the social viabil- ity of this dispute. Her analysis raises important concerns about the possibility of problematic social processes that may be enacted during this dispute.p. 98 Ilana Seidel Horn 99 examples of participation structures commonly found in classrooms are whole- class discussion, group work, and teacher tutoring. On a descriptive level, those participation structures provide a way of seeing a given activity. On an analytic level, participation structures allow for the inves- tigation of the relations between social actors and their interactions. That is, the examination of classroom participation structures supports the analysis of the re- lations among students, the teacher, and the various classroom activities, lending insights into the organizational possibilities and limitations for participation and learning. In studying participation structures, researchers seek to codify (a) those relations, (b) the corresponding positions, and (c) the normative expectations for appropriate conduct. From there, patterns in interaction among participants can be highlighted and analyzed (Goffman, 1981; Hanks, 1996). In educational research, analyses of the organization of classroom participation-and the way various classroom participants draw on, resist, and transform that organization-allow for context-specific descriptions of learning. The Discourse of Disagreements To understand disagreements in this classroom, I draw on three sources. The first source is Magdalene Lampert, who, along with her colleagues, has written about the role of disagreements in her discussion-intensive mathematics class- room (Lampert, 1990; Lampert, Rittenhouse, & Crumbaugh, 1996). Lampert and colleagues' analysis describes the social and personal tensions that arise as stu- dents engage in academic disputes, which the authors see as having a place in mathematical learning. They argue that engaging in disagreement is closer to au- thentic mathematical and scientific practice than the types of discourse that typify traditional classrooms. As the authors say, "by posing interpretable problems and encouraging disagreement, the teacher sets the stage for students to clarify their thinking and relate thought to communication" (p. 738). How that stage is set, the roles available to the players, and the discursive details of the drama of dis- agreements are not a focal part of their analysis but are explored in this chapter. Interestingly, in those discursive details lie a multitude of interactional strategies that participants employ to manage the social and personal tensions as they en- gage in disagreements. Including disagreements in the teaching of mathematics is, in part, an attempt to bring mathematical pedagogy closer to the rigors of formal academic practice (Chazan & Ball, 1995; Lampert et al., 1996). Accounts of authentic academic disputation practices thus provide a useful framework for sorting out some of the complexities that arise during academic disagreements. Bruno Latour's (1987) work on this aspect of scientific practice provides a way to delve more deeply into those complexities. Specifically, his analysis provides a language for the strategies scientists use (e.g., recruiting allies, reifying ideas through inscriptions) and the positions they take (e.g., dissenter) in the course of disagreements. It turns out that the members of Ball's classroom, in their appropriation of academic argumenta-p. 99 100 Accountable Argumentation tion, employ some of the same strategies and position themselves in ways similar to those used by professional scientists. Finally, because the students are children who bring in their own personal un- derstandings of how disagreements are managed, Marjorie Goodwin's (1991) lin- guistic ethnography of urban black children's talk sheds insight into the discourse of peer disputes. Although the students in Ball's classroom come from diverse ethnic backgrounds (see Appendix 2 of this volume), the analytic categories that emerged from Goodwin's fine-grained ethnographic work illuminate many of the relational stakes involved in children's arguments, as well as a detailed analysis of the strategies they employ in those interactions without the mediation of adults. Bringing those three perspectives together, this chapter elaborates the role of language as a resource for positioning students in the course of mathematical dis- agreements in the classroom. Specifically, this analysis illustrates the participation structure of accountable argumentation. DATA AND METHODS Data Deborah Ball provided access to her rich set of data from this classroom, which was collected as part of the Mathematics and Teaching Through Hypermedia (M.A.T.H.) Project. The primary data for this analysis were the videotape of the January 19, 1990, class session and a transcript of the session. In addition, to challenge and strengthen the analysis that emerged from the primary data, I also reviewed a transcript of the previous day's session; Ball's journals from the days leading up to, including, and following January 19; copies of the students' note- books from January 19; and prior analyses of the day's events (Ball, 1998; Ball & Bass, 2000). Those secondary data sources were used to seek confirming and disconfirming evidence of the analysis presented here. Methods Methodological approach. Methods from both conversation analysis and socio- linguistics were employed in this analysis. Conversation analysis seeks to describe the underlying organization of social interaction. To do so, it requires an integrated analysis of action and local context, with the assumption that speakers constantly influence and constrain the conduct of their copartioipants. Because coparticipants in interaction rely on spoken utterances or other actions to interpret a situation, this, too, is the point of departure for conversation analysts (C. Goodwin & Heritage, 1990; Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). The utterances and actions of the stu- dents and teacher comprised the primary data on which this analysis relies. Sociolinguistics adds depth to the conversation about the analytic notion of context by using ethnographic methods to interpret interactions beyond the im- mediate and local context created by talk and action alone (M. Goodwin, 1991; O'Connor & Michaels, 1996). Thus, the analysis in this chapter seeks to interpretp. 100 ilana Seidel Horn 101 the spoken utterances and gestures of the class participants in the broader contexts of interaction, such as the previous day's class and the teacher's perspective as represented by her reflections on the class discussion. Although the interpretations of the context did not come from traditional ethnographic data, the rich and vari- ous data that Ball's group provided deepened the understandings of the multiple contexts that influenced the local interactions. Data analysis. In general, data analysis proceeded in a recursive and nonlinear fashion. For narrative simplicity, I describe three phases of analysis, despite the fact that these phases blurred in time. This description of phases should be taken as an outline of my analytic logic rather than a strict chronology of the analytic process. In the first phase of the analysis, the video was repeatedly reviewed alongside the transcript provided by Deborah Ball (Appendix 1 to this volume). The dis- agreement episodes were coded in the original transcript, and are presented in Table 3.1. While reviewing the disagreement episodes across the class session, I took note of the disagreement episodes in which students managed their exchang- es with one another with little or no teacher mediation. I considered those inter- actions as examples of socially viable disagreements among peers. I wanted to further understand how the students managed those interactions, especially since everyday disagreements are often socially uncomfortable and are thus frequently avoided. In addition, during the repeated viewing phase, I annotated the transcript with notes about participants' location, intonation, and gestures that amplified or shifted their meanings in ways not represented by their words alone. As a part of that work, I set about categorizing the disagreement episodes. To decide whether a disagreement was sustained, I looked not so much for the num- ber of turns within it but rather whether the argument maintained a mathematical focus. As previously mentioned, I also looked at the teacher's role (did the teacher strongly scaffold the disagreement, or did the students manage the disagreement with little teacher intervention?). I also took note of which students initiated the disagreement, as well as to whom the disagreement was directed. In Phase 2, I selected two episodes for close analysis. Because I was interested in the social viability of those student-student disagreements, I focused on episodes that were not strongly scaffolded by the teacher. To help me understand differences in how the disagreements were managed by students, the two episodes differed in how successfully the argumentation was sustained. For this phase, I wanted to pay close attention to language and action, so I used a thoroughly revised transcript of the episodes that included more of the false starts, repeated words, and acknowl- edgment tokens ("mm-hm"'s), using transcript conventions common to this type of analysis (Ochs, 1979; see Table 3.2). Those revised transcripts are excerpted in this chapter. The additional utterances, along with notes about gesture, physical location, and intonation, became important clues for understanding and interpret- ing interaction in context. The trade-off, of course, is that the transcripts excerpted in this chapter may be less readable, but for those accustomed to the notation, they provide greater access to the sound and pace of the conversations.p. 101 Table 3.1.

As was described in the "Participation Structures" section, par- ticipant structures codify relations among participants through an analysis of positions taken and normative expectations for conduct. To understand the or- ganization of those disagreements, codes were developed for the elements of a participant structure: interactional roles, as well as norms and expectations. Roles described the interactional work participants did while engaging in a dis- agreement. Norms referred to the standards or patterns of social behavior that were accepted in, or expected of, the class but were more tacit than the explicitly stated expectations. Those codes were revised and revisited throughout the cod- ing process. Once the revised codes satisfactorily described the interaction in the two focal episodes, they were then applied to the other disagreement episodes and Ball's journals. When the categories captured the range of disagreements, they were deemed satisfactory. In the final phase, I developed a framework for how roles, norms, and ex- pectations functioned in interaction to sustain (or not) students' disagreements. Looking at argumentation in interaction, I developed the following two insights: (1) the delegation of interactional roles had predictable patterns; and (2) the use of prior conversations was crucial to the way disagreements unfolded. After inte- grating those insights into the analysis, I applied the framework and insights to all the disagreement episodes and found no inconsistencies in the way the framework and insights captured them.p. 103 104 Accountable Argumentation In the next section, I explicate the structure of accountable argumentation. Then I illustrate how it works in action through a close analysis of the two closely tran- scribed episodes of student-student disagreements. The first episode illustrates an instance in which accountable argumentation is not sustained, and the second epi- sode shows an instance in which accountable argumentation is sustained and gen- erates new mathematics for the class. Ball's minimal scaffolding in these episodes presumably increased the social stakes for the students, making these episodes salient for my particular questions. FINDINGS: ACCOUNTABLE ARGUMENTATION IN ACTION Overview of Findings The following analysis provides an abstract and then an enacted description of accountable argumentation. First, I describe the abstract structure of accountable argumentation by delineating the norms, expectations, roles, and uses of history that define it. Next, I illustrate accountable argumentation by presenting the analy- sis of the two focal disagreement episodes. Episode 1 occurred during the first six minutes of the January 19, 1990, class session and illustrates how accountable argumentation, compared with other participation structures in the classroom, supports mathematical reasoning and learning. Episode 2, a disagreement that occurs later in the class session, shows how the interactional roles in accountable argumentation constitute a resource for the development of mathematical ideas. During Episode 2, the odd-and-even concept is made more general and, therefore, more mathematical. Accountable Argumentation: The Abstract Structure of Participation Accountable argumentation is a participation structure, embedded in whole- class discussion, that organizes the public disagreements among students and provides interactional resources for clear mathematical reasoning and the produc- tion of mathematical generalizations. I call this structure accountable argumenta- tion because it behooves participants to be responsible for many elements of the discussion. Participants are held accountable for following their peers' thinking, remembering previously developed mathematical ideas, and producing rigorous reasoning and justification.2 Norms and expectations. Although I coded norms and expectations separately in the data analysis, I report them together here for reasons of space and simplic- ity. In the analysis, I coded regularities in classroom interaction as norms (Yackel & Cobb, 1996; McClain & Cobb, 2001), whereas explicit statements that sought to structure participation were coded as expectations. This distinction is not con- sequential for understanding the participation structure of accountable argumen- tation, as what may look like norms in one class session may be explicitly stated as expectations in another. 2 For a similar use of the word accountable, please see Resnick (1999).p. 104 ilana Seidel Horn 105 Norms and expectations contribute to the organization of participants' activities by both constraining and providing a resource for those activities. Since account- able argumentation is embedded in the whole-class discussions in Ball's class- room, the norms and expectations described are common to both participation structures. Listed below are some norms and expectations that structurally distinguish ac- countable argumentation from what might be thought of as more typical whole- class discussion.' Each one is briefly described or illustrated using excerpts from the class session. Participants in this classroom are expected to do the following: 1. Attend to contributions in a whole-class discussion Ball: And could you listen to one another's comments, so that we can, um, (1) ben- efit from what other people say? Ball: Tembe, are you listening to Riba? She's trying something else now. 2. Value disagreements and understand that they may not (and need not) be resolved Ball: I understand that this is a problem and that we didn't ... settle it. We're prob- ably not going to settle it. Ball: Anybody want to comment on this, or is this one of the examples of some- thing we've got to let rest a little bit now? 3. Support thinking during discussions through the allocation of attention and time. Ball. Riba, can you watch what Mei's doing? Mei: Let's say that I have (7 second pause). Let's see. 4. Have a justified position in a discussion Ball: What are you convinced by? Sheena: I don't, I don't agree with that. Ball: Why? 5. Act on or defend a position in a discussion Sean: I disagree because, um, because what= what two things can you put together to make it? Ball: You're going to have to help because she's talking to you and I'm not sure what she's trying to show. 6. Use terms from the mathematical and academic registers. Tembe: Prove it to us! 3 I am contrasting accountable argumentation with two forms of whole-class discussion, the first being typical whole-class discussion found in U.S. classrooms (Stigler & Hiebert, 1999) and the sec- ond being whole-class discussion in Ball's class. Accountable argumentation is embedded in the latter and thus shares some characteristics with whole-class discussion in that setting.p. 105 106 Accountable Argumentation Ofala: My conjecture, I think it's always true. 7. Respectfully respond to others 'positions in a discussion Sheena: Could you repeat what you said, please? Sean: I didn't think of that that way. Thank you for bringing it up. 8. Revise a position in light of new questions or convincing evidence. Ball: [...] Sheena commented that (.) it was good to have the two classes together because she heard an idea that she hadn't thought about and it made her think about and even revise her own idea when she was (.) in the meeting yesterday. Nathan: First I said zero was even but then I guess I revised so that zero, I think zero is special. These norms and expectations are communicated consistently through the par- ticipants' interactions. Often, violations are noted explicitly, as when a student is not listening attentively (e.g., "Were you not listening to this just now?") or when somebody has not adequately substantiated a controversial position (e.g., "Prove it to us!"). Note that the norms and expectations of accountable argumentation vary radically from those of traditional mathematics classrooms, in which the au- thority of the text or teacher supersedes students' valuation of their own thinking (Schoenfeld, 1988). Ball, in her role as teacher, takes primary interactional responsibility for the first four norms and expectations during the class session examined for this analysis. Ball and the students themselves hold one another accountable for the last four. Perhaps over time, all participants learn to hold themselves and one another in- creasingly accountable for meeting all these norms and expectations. Taken together, these norms and expectations support the social viability and mathematical productivity of disagreements in Ball's classroom. Norms and Expectations 4 through 6 shape the rigor of the disagreements. By expecting stu- dents to not only take a position in an argument but also defend that position using academic language, the participation structure creates a high-press environment for student learning (Kazemi & Stipek, 2001). Norms and Expectations 6 through 8 help support the social viability of classroom disagreements. The academic lan- guage used for these disagreements may help distinguish them from everyday playground disputes, while the polite tones and normalization of "revising" allow students to maintain a civil tone and save face. Roles. The roles described subsequently are those that are taken up and enact- ed during accountable argumentation sequences during whole-class discussions. This description of roles reflects an inductive analysis of the discursive practices in the classroom, and their labels have been borrowed from other accounts of disagreements in both discourse analysis (Goffman, 1974) and the social studies of science (Latour, 1987).p. 106 ilana Seidel Horn 107 The following roles are available to participants engaged in accountable argumentation: 1. Principal of a controversy (Goffman, 1974, p. 517): A person held account- able for a position that others disagree with or question. 2. Dissenter (Latour, 1987): A person who takes an opposing position to the principal's position. 3. Ally (Latour, 1987): A person (or thing) who (or that) supports the principal's position. During disagreements, participants may take up any of these first three roles. Oftentimes, they blend them with one or more of the following: 4. Questioner: A person who asks questions, especially of the principal, per- haps because of confusion or an uncertain stance. 5. Reasoner.- A person who provides an exposition of reasoning. 6. Listener: A person who listens to the arguments. 7. Norm-maintainer: A person who explicitly evokes norms during conversation. 8. Clarifier: A person who clarifies or summarizes another participant's state- ment. As will be illustrated in Episode 2, clarifying may be the first half of a revoicing move (O'Connor & Michaels, 1996). In this description, I do not wish to suggest that these roles are explicitly del- egated or stable over time. The roles are occupied through highly contingent, ne- gotiated social processes that will be explicated in the following section. Negotiating roles in interaction. Participants in discussion can utilize these roles as resources in several ways. First, they can assume (Goffman, 1974) the various roles for themselves through their talk. For example, by beginning a speaking turn with the statement "I disagree with Joe," a participant assumes the role of dissent- er. Second, participants can design (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974) others in these roles. With the same utterance ("I disagree with Joe"), the speaker designs Joe as a principal of a controversy. Once that role has been ratified (C. Goodwin & Heritage, 1990) by the designated principal-Joe might silently turn and face his interlocutor or, more explicitly, say, "Okay, what's your question?"-the stakes are then raised for Joe to act on or defend the controversial position for which he is now accountable. Finally, participants can animate (M. Goodwin, 1991) others in these roles. In the midst of summarizing an argument, for instance, a speaker may juxtapose the positions of two participants to point out their agreement on an issue. In this situation, the two participants are animated as allies. History Through animation, speakers can strategically recycle past utterances or posi- tions in the present interaction. By animating a past speaker's position, current speakers can recruit allies or take positions of dissent. Additionally, becausep. 107 108 Accountable Argumentation participants are frequently animated as holding positions from previous class ses- sions, this continuity intensifies participants' day-to-day accountability for their positions on a topic. Participants may be yoked (O'Connor & Michaels, 1996) into a discussion when their past positions are recycled, connecting them with present discussions through the animation of a current speaker. Some aspects of history are also brought into the present through the use of inscriptions (Latour, 1987), which are representations that reify ideas, serve as pedagogical devices, support talk over and about them, and support the recycling of past arguments (Greeno & Hall, 1997; Roth & McGinn, 1998). Inscriptions provide important mediating resources for argumentation. In fact, inscriptions themselves are often animated as allies during reasoning sequences, as is illus- trated in Episode 1. In this classroom, a few inscriptions are featured in the course of the discussion. These instances are representations of numbers from which evenness or oddness may be derived, including the number-line representation, a hash mark representa- tion (for example, 4 would be represented as IIII), and a "cookie" representation of numbers (0 0 0 0). These representations.support different understandings of even and odd. That is, the number line highlights the alternation of even and odd integers, and, although both the hash mark and cookie representations allow for "grouping by twos," individual cookies are more easily "split in half." These inscriptions and their entailments are summarized in Table 3.3. Table 3.3.

Accountable Argumentation Illustrated In this section, accountable argumentation is illustrated through the analysis of two episodes of interaction in the context of whole-class discussion. The features of the abstract structure-that is, the norms and expectations, roles, and uses of history-provide the conceptual language for this analysis. Episode 1 shows an instance in which accountable argumentation is neither sustained nor productive. In the analysis of this episode, I contrast accountable argumentation with other participant structures organizing the students' disagreement to illustrate the op- portunities for learning that accountable argumentation provides. Episode 2 shows an instance in which accountable argumentation is both sustained and productive.p. 108 Ilana Seidel Horn 109 In the analysis of this episode, I show how the roles in accountable argumentation support students' mathematical thinking. Episode 1: A Disagreement About Zero Overview of participation structures in Episode 1. This episode traces a dis- agreement about zero as enacted by two students in Ball's class, Sean and Sheena. The episode starts in a whole-class discussion format in Part 1, with Sheena discussing with Ball her current thinking about the evenness or oddness of zero after the previous day's meeting. An accountable argumentation sequence begins in Part 2, when Sean disagrees with Sheena's position, and continues in Part 3, when Sheena defends her position. Accountable argumentation gives way to a peer-dispute format (M. Goodwin, 1991) at the end of the episode, at which point Ball steps back in and redirects the activity to a whole-class discussion. In addi- tion to illustrating some important features of accountable argumentation, this episode shows the contiguous relationships of the participation structures in the classroom and the fluid transitions between them. Part 1: Reflecting on a position. At the beginning of the class session, Ball opens up the discussion by asking that students reflect on the previous day's meet- ing with the fourth graders on the topic of zero's oddness or evenness. Structurally, this format is a whole-class discussion with the teacher allocating turns of talk and designating the topic, which is "reflection on yesterday's meeting." Sheena, in dialogue with Ball, goes public with the position she has arrived at: 5 Ball: Was there an example of something yesterday that (.) you understood a little bit more (.) during the Imeeting?] 6 Sheena: //Well:], I didn't think that zero was (.) zero, um even or (.) odd until yesterday they said that it could be even because of the ones on each side is odd, so that couldn't beI/odd.] 7 Ball: IIHmm.] So y 8 Sheena: =So that helped me understand it. In this sequence of dialogue, Ball supports Sheena in taking a specific position on the topic of yesterday's discussion by asking her to provide a specific example of something she "understood a little bit more." In Turn 6, Sheena recycles an argument linked with the number-line inscription to substantiate her reasoning ("because the 1's on each side is odd, so that couldn't be odd"), bringing part of yesterday's discussion into the present interaction. She describes being convinced by something "they said" (Turn 6) that "helped [her] understand it" (Turn 8), con- forming to the expectation that her position be reasoned. Part 2: Initiating accountable argumentation. When Sean is called on as the next student to speak, he reorganizes the interaction from a discussion reflecting on yesterday's meeting to accountable argumentation: 11 Ball: Other people's comments? Sean?p. 109 110 Accountable Argumentation 12 Sean: Um, I, I, I just want to say something to Sheena =when sh/ what she said about um (.) that (.) that one, um zero has to be an odd/an even number bec/ I disagree because, um, because what- what two things can you put together to make it? 13 Sheena: (1) Could you repeat what you said, please? 14 Ball: ((speaks to Betsy and asks her to listen)) 15 Sean: (1) Okay, um, I disagree with you because (.) um, if it was an even number, how/what two things could make it? Perhaps because he is redirecting the activity from reflection to accountable argumentation, Sean somewhat haltingly prefaces his disagreement in Turn 12. In this preface, Sean addresses Sheena indirectly, using her name ("I, I, I just want to say something to Sheena"). After Sheena directly addresses him (Turn 13) and he takes a slight pause, Sean addresses her in the second person ("Okay, um, I disagree with you"). This pattern of assuming a position of dissent by start- ing in third person ("Sheena") and changing to second person ("you") only after the dissent has been ratified by other participants occurs elsewhere during the class session. This occurrence may mark a transition point from addressing the teacher in whole-class discussion to addressing a peer in accountable argumenta- tion. Possibly this strategy also helps students manage the relational discomfort of disagreeing with one another. To understand this point more fully, consider the range of possible alternatives. On the one hand, if a dissenter initiated a dispute in the second person ("you"), the dispute might immediately seem personal. On the other hand, if a dissenter were to address a vague third person ("somebody said"), an expansive, general- ized principal ("people who think..."), or simply the idea in general ("about the idea that zero is ..."), the controversy's trajectory is more limited because no one is the obvious respondent to the dissenting point. By comparison, the initiation of a dispute in the third person avoids the harsh confrontational tone of the second person while sustaining the accountability of the principal to any position he or she has publicly taken. After Sean designs Sheena as the principal of a disagreement, Sheena ratifies the role of principal and now takes on the rights and obligations of that role. Principals in this classroom, for example, are obligated to defend their position in a disagreement by explicating their reasoning. They also have the right to assume a central position in the classroom, both physically and discursively, as will be il- lustrated in this example (and in Figure 3.1). In Turn 15, Sean formulates a question for Sheena. He merges the roles of dis- senter and questioner, employing a common way for dissenters to account for their own positions in this classroom. Sean supports his dissent by asking a question that reflects his understanding of even numbers. That is, his statement reflects an understanding that even numbers are made up of two like numbers, an understand- ing supported by the circle or hash mark representations. By posing a question, Sean also designs Sheena as having a reasoned position from which she can re- spond and underscores her obligation to defend her now-controversial position.p. 110 Rlana Seidel Horn 111 When students have stepped into the roles of principal and dissenter, Ball no longer manages speaking turns from her position of teacher. The student-student dialogues during whole-class discussions occur during accountable argumenta- tion sequences, once the roles of principal and dissenter have been assumed and ratified in interaction. This aspect of accountable argumentation decentralizes the teacher's authority to mandate turns, allowing students to manage some of their own interaction. In this sequence of dialogue, Ball quietly works as a norm-maintainer by asking Betsy to listen to the discussion. In doing so, she designs Betsy as a listener in the discussion and underscores the expectation of attending to the arguments in a controversy, even when one does not hold the floor. Part 3: Defending a position. Sheena then goes on to defend her position: 16 Sheena: Well, I could show you it. (.) ((Moves toward the chalkboard and points to the number line with a yard stick)) Urn, I forgot wh/what his name was, but yesterday he said that this one ((Points to the 1 on the number line)) and each, this one is odd and this one ((Points to the-1 on the number line)) is odd, so this one ((Points to the zero)) has to be even. Figure 3.1. Sheena defends her position at the number line. (Source: videotape of Deborah Ball's class, January 19, 1990, M.A.T.H. Project.)p. 111continuous tone image 112 Accountable Argumentation Sheena, in the position of principal, must justify her position on zero. To sup- port her effort, she moves into what is typically the teacher's position at the front of the room near the chalkboard, a location of interactional authority and visual centrality. Additionally, she recruits two important allies from yesterday's meeting, ap- pealing to the history of this controversy over zero. During the exposition of her position, Sheena first allies herself with one of the fourth-grade boys ("I forgot wh/what his name was"), giving him authorship of her reasoning over the number line ("but yesterday he said"). This move accomplishes two things for Sheena. First, the alliance with an older (and perhaps therefore more authoritative) boy shows that Sheena's position is not anomalous but rather shared by another, per- haps more knowledgeable, peer. Second, this move alleviates some of the rela- tional pressures of the principal position, inasmuch as the unnamed boy is the author of the argument and not Sheena herself. Sheena also invokes the number-line inscription (and, as a consequence, the argument it represents) as an ally to substantiate her position, even though Sean's question actually refers to a representation of even numbers (Turn 15: "what two things could make it?") that relies on the notion of even numbers being comprised of same-sized pairs. They are thus engaged in cross-representational discussion, because the alternating pattern of the number line and the two-groups representa- tions reflect different aspects of evenness. Part 4: From accountable argumentation to peer dispute.4 At this point, per- haps because of the seemingly incommensurable representations of evenness, the discussion shifts and takes on a format sometimes found in peer disputes (M. Goodwin, 1991). In the peer-dispute format that emerges, Sean and Sheena echo each other's utterances; their exchange is an example of format tying (M. Goodwin, 1991, p. 177), a reciprocal action that transforms Sheena's meaning and escalates rather than explicates the dispute. 17 Sean: But that doesn't mean it always is even. 18 Sheena: It could be even. 19 Sean: It could be, but 20 Sheena: I'm not saying that it ha::s to be even.A/I meant that it could be.] 21 Sean: /You said it was] ((Sheena puts the yardstick back in the chalk tray and looks up at Ball.)) 22 Ball: (2) Before we take this up again, I underst/I (.) I understand that this is still a problem = and that we didn't a/we didn't settle it. (.) ((Sheena returns to her seat.)) We're probably not going to settle it. (.) U:m (.) there's a lot of disagreement about this issue, right? And you saw that the fourth graders 4 By drawing this contrast, I do not wish to suggest that peer dispute never has features of account- able argumentation. Goodwin (1990) describes, for example, the uses of proof and justification that are often employed within peer disputes. The polite tones, public forum, classroom setting, and appropriation of the mathematical register do seem to distinguish accountable argumentation from typical peer disputes.p. 112 Ilana Seidel Horn 113 who have been thinking about this for a long time also disagree about it, don't they? I'm still kind of interested (.) um:, in hearing some more comments about the meeting itself [...] Sean's challenge in Turn 17 recalls a category of numbers that emerged in the prior day's discussion. In conventional mathematics, even and odd are mutually exclusive categories of integers. During the previous day's meeting, some students held the position that zero is perhaps both odd and even, a special number that straddles categories. The "odd and even" category eliminates the mutual exclu- sivity of even numbers and odd numbers, which the number-line representation reifies. In Turns 18 through 20, Sheena weakens her commitment to her position that zero is even by hedging ("It could be even"), further distancing herself from her original position in the face of Sean's dissent. Her position in Turn 6 (zero "couldn't be odd") has been transformed in the course of this disagreement to the statement in Turn 20. Sean's response (Turn 19), a partial repetition of Sheena's prior talk, does not represent further reasoning about the issue at hand but rather serves mainly to escalate the dispute. Sean's addition of "but" might index his previous Turn 17 ("But that doesn't mean it always is even"), thus continuing to push his position without providing further justification. At this phase of the dis- pute, neither Sheena nor Sean formulates explanations to accompany her or his assertions. This exchange and return sequence (M. Goodwin, 1991, p. x) indicates that the students are no longer focused on the validity or invalidity of each other's statements. The peer-dispute format that now organizes the exchange subsumes accountable argumentation's emphasis on reasoned positions. Sheena eventually retreats from her original stance and replaces the yardstick in the chalk tray (Turn 20), signaling the termination of the dispute, even though no explicit resolution has been reached.5 Sheena continues to stand at the center of the room, near the chalkboard in the physical position of principal, although she has discarded her primary tool. This action signifies an ambiguous moment of role transition, open for design by others. Sheena's glance at Ball invites the teacher's next move. After a two-second pause, Ball steps in to normalize the unresolved ending (Turn 22). When she does so, Sheena picks up the cue to relinquish her role as principal and returns to her seat. Ball says aloud that "we didn't settle it" referring to the disagreement about zero. Her use of the pronoun we reestablishes the dis- pute as a collective issue for the whole class to grapple with, clearly demarcating it from a personal conflict between Sean and Sheena. Ball continues to underscore the unresolved status of this issue, emphasizing that "we're probably not going to settle it," before she redirects the activity to whole-class discussion. This move serves to normalize disagreements in her classroom while moving the students back to her original agenda. 5 Such closings provide what Goffman (1971, p. 140, as cited in M. Goodwin, 1990) calls "ritual equilibrium."p. 113 114 Accountable Argumentation Discussion of Episode 1. This disagreement illustrates some of the social stakes of publicly stating one's position on an issue. Sheena, in the context of reflecting on the previous day's meeting, is encouraged by Ball (Turns 5 through 8) to have a principled position about zero's oddness or evenness. In that context, she elabo- rates her stance to Ball to fulfill the expectation of supporting her position. In doing so, however, she makes her position public, which then opens her up to dis- sent from others. When Sean acts as a dissenter to her position, she manages the pressure of the role of principal of a controversy by recruiting allies and distanc- ing herself from authorship of her position. The cross-representational discussion escalates the disagreement. At this point, the two students abandon accountable argumentation for a peer-dispute format that does not rely on reasoned positions, at which point Sheena hedges and eventually retreats from her stance. When Ball steps in and redirects the activity to whole-class discussion, she appears to be choosing to return to the original topic and format that she set out (a whole-class discussion reflecting on yesterday's meeting). Had she wished to pursue the disagreement further, accountable argumentation could have contin- ued. Although Sean and Sheena had arrived at an impasse, possibly a clarifier or a questioner-whether from Ball or another student-could have entered the conversation to point out, or ask about, the mismatch between their respective representations. Ball's choice to end the accountable argumentation sequence and leave the dispute unresolved is noteworthy. She prioritizes her other objectives for that day's lesson over the resolution of this disagreement. Even though the disagreement ends without a visibly reasoned resolution, the structure of accountable argumentation still supports mathematical learning in this episode. Comparing, for example, Sheena's first statement in her position on zero (Part 1, Turn 6) with her explanation as principal (Part 3, Turn 16), we see that the latter explanation is more clearly stated. Standing at the center of the room, Sheena's communication has a different purpose: she is no longer communicating her reflections on yesterday's meeting to her teacher; instead she must defend her- self in front of the whole class because her position has been called into question. From this central location, she has the number-line inscription and yardstick to use as resources to support her justification. In this example, we see how account- able argumentation supports Sheena's mathematical learning. First, by shifting the audience from a sympathetic teacher to a dissenting peer, accountable argu- mentation provided a compelling impetus for her to become more articulate and formal about her position. Additionally, by entitling Sheena, as principal, to the interactional center of the room-with its visible representational resources-ac- countable argumentation provided a means for her to step into a teaching position from which she can access and display inscriptions to support her justification. Accountable argumentation as a participation structure uniquely supports this learning. Had the class' activity retained the organization of whole-class discus- sion, Sheena would not necessarily have needed to repeat her position or find a way to articulate it more clearly. Similarly, the linguistic and interactional resourc- es of accountable argumentation supported the productive disagreement in Partsp. 114 ilana Seidel Horn 115 2 and 3 of this episode, during which Sean states his disagreement and Sheena defends her position. In contrast, the peer-dispute format in Part 4, by shifting the focus away from evaluating the validity of one's argument to posturing and hedg- ing, does not support displays of reasoning. Episode 2: A Disagreement About Six The controversy about six described in the introduction of this volume con- sumes much of the class session. It begins when Sean publicly states that he thinks six is an odd-and-even number, a statement that quickly incites dissent from his peers. In the process of arguing this controversy, the class participants coconstruct the odd and even numbers. By tracing the progression of this idea, we can see how accountable argumen- tation provides the interactional resources for the development of the odd-and- evens. With Sean taking the role of principal in this controversy, the other partici- pants in the class, through their dissent, collaboratively transform his utterance from a particular statement about six (that it could be an odd and an even number) to a general class of numbers. This movement from the particular to the general is quintessentially mathematical (Jurow, 2004) and, as is argued here, is a type of transformation supported by accountable argumentation. Although many participants undoubtedly contributed to the discussion and, more specifically, to the construction of the odd-and-evens, I focus on one inter- action between Sean and Mei, in which accountable argumentation supports the transformation of the statement about six. Overview of roles in Episode 2. Whereas Episode 1 contrasted accountable ar- gumentation with other participation structures in its capacity to support student learning, Episode 2 illustrates the ways in which the roles of accountable argu- mentation may help support generative mathematical thinking. In Part 1 of this episode, Sean, as a principal of the controversy about six, is struggling to articu- late his position when Mei enters the interaction to help him clarify the nature of the category of odd-and-even. In Part 2, Mei shifts roles and acts as a dissenter, although she does so by appropriating Sean's perspective. Proceeding in this man- ner, she justifies her dissent in Part 3 by acting as a reasoner and generating a second example of odd-and-even. Her dissent from within Sean's viewpoint, it turns out, is mathematically generative, and the roles of accountable argumenta- tion support this work. Part1: Clarifying. Sean, as the principal of this controversy about six, is en- gaged in an accountable argumentation sequence. He is standing at the board try- ing to prove his statement to his current dissenter, Tembe: 1 Sean: Because, because see this, there's two ((drawing)) number two over here, put that there. Put this here. 00100100 There's two- two, and two. And that would make six.p. 115 116 Accountable Argumentation 2 Mei: I think I know what he's saying. 3 Tembe: Which is even, Sean. 4 Ball: Mei? 5 Sean: Yeah, and it could be (odd). ((Sean walks away from the board)) 6 Ball: Could you stay there? People have some questions for you. 7 Mei: I think what he is saying is tha:::t. -h, it's almost, see/ ((Mei stands up in her seat)) I THINK what he's saying is that ((Sits back down, grabbing back of seat)) you have THREE ((holds up three fingers)) groups of TWO. ((holds up two fingers)) And three is an ODD number -h ((waving two fingers; rotates to face Ball)) so (.) SIX can be an odd number a::nd a even number. Note that Ball maintains Sean at the center of the classroom (Turn 6). Ball tells him to stay at the board, the physical center of the classroom discussion, and explains that people have questions for him, highlighting his corresponding in- teractional centrality. The expectations of the principal role are maintained in her request: Sean must continue to stand up-quite literally-for his position. After his unsuccessful attempt to explain his position to Tembe, he seeks to abandon his physical (and perhaps some of his interactional) centrality. In Turn 2, Mei steps in as a clarifier. Once her turn is ratified, she begins in Turn 7 what O'Connor and Michaels (1996) call a revoicing move. Revoicing is "a par- ticular kind of reuttering (oral or written) of a student's contribution-by another participant in the discussion" (p. 71), which then opens up a slot in conversation for the original author of the statement to agree or disagree. In her role as clarifier, Mei does the first part of the revoicing move: she reformulates Sean's statement about six, highlighting his focus on the fact that three, the number of groups of two, is an odd number. In describing the pattern, Mei's reformulation not only clarifies but starts to generalize Sean's statement. Ball then finishes the revoicing move by opening up the slot to Sean for con- firmation or disconfirmation. O'Connor and Michaels explain that this part of the revoicing move "ultimately credits the contents of the reformulation to the student" (p. 71). Thus, Sean, whose talk has been animated and reformulated by Mei, maintains his participation status in the conversation as the originator of the statement; as such, he is positioned to confirm or disconfirm Mei's interpretation of his statement.p. 116 Ilana Seidel Horn 117 Part 2: Dissent. Mei then changes her interactional role. Ball asks her if she dis- agrees with Sean, designing her as a dissenter, a role that Mei readily assumes: 13 Mei: Yeah, I disagree with that because -h ((Stands upfacing Ball)) it's not acco::rding to like, -h/ ((Pushes chair under table)) Here. Can I show it on the board? 14 Ball: ((pacing behind Mei's group's table)) Um hm ((nods)). 15 Mei: ((walking toward board, where Sean stands, leaning)) It's not according ((arriving at board, picking up chalk)) I/to like how many groups it is.] ((pointing to Sean's diagram)) Mei positions herself as a dissenter in relation to the reinterpreted statement about six. In Turn 13, Mei ratifies the position of dissenter by disagreeing "with that"- Sean's position, not Sean himself. This tactic is another strategy dissenters employ to manage the potentially personal feelings that come along with disagreement. In assuming the role of dissenter, Mei immediately begins moving in to sup- port her position. In Turn 13, she gets out of her chair while beginning to state her opposition. She seeks Ball's permission to go to the board, where Sean has been positioned in Turn 6. Moving and talking simultaneously, Mei states her point: "It's not according to like how many groups it is." By naming what she disagrees with, she further generalizes Sean's statement about six to describe a characteristic (the number of groups of two) that could also be found in other even numbers. Mei thus voices her dissent by arguing on more general grounds than Sean himself articulated. Importantly, Mei's work as clarifier helped open a path for her dissent. Recall the previous disagreement between Sean and Sheena in Episode 1, in which Sean's dis- sent employed a different feature of even numbers than that on which Sheena's po- sition was based (pairs of like numbers versus the alternating pattern on the number line). In contrast, Mei first establishes the grounds for Sean's thinking about six and then disagrees with him on his own terms, in what might be thought of as empathic dissent. That is, she projects herself into his perspective in an attempt to understand him better and continues to argue from within that perspective.

Five/!ten can be an odd and an even? //(???) can be an odd and a leven, an even] In Episode 1, Sean merged the roles of dissenter and questioner to substantiate his disagreement with Sheena. Here, Mei has moved through the role of clarifier to dissenter, and finally, to dissenter-reasoner. She applies her established under- standing that, in his statement about six, Sean is attending to the number ofgroups of two to generate a second example of an odd-and-even number, the instance of ten (Turn 19). Not only has she taken his perspective on the category of odd-and- even, but her example uses the same inscription that he used in his interaction with Tembe in Part 1, underscoring her strategy of appropriating his viewpoint in empathic dissent. From her central position at the board, she generates a second instance of an odd-and-even number using the same cookie representation. By reasoning from within his perspective, she sustains accountable argumentation in structuring this interaction. Unlike in the cross-representational discussion thatp. 118 Ilana Seidel Horn 119 took place in Episode 1, the students here are using the same inscription and thus able to have enough common ground in their argument to move it forward. Figure 3.2. Sean and Mei disagreeing about six. Note Mei's drawing of ten, below Sean's drawing of six, on the chalkboard. (Source: videotape of Deborah Ball's class, January 19, 1990, M.A.T.H. Project.) The example of ten provides an even more significant move toward generaliza- tion: two examples of numbers with the same property (they can be partitioned into an odd number of pairs) open the possibility for a mathematically defined class of numbers. In her role as reasoner, Mei clearly generates the example often; however, because she is reasoning in service of her dissent, she does not interac- tionally take ownership of the example of ten. For her purposes, it is a strategic attempt to find a counterexample: a number that is known to be even but also has an odd number of groups of two. Because of her purposes in generating this example, she continues to position Sean as the originator of the example of ten in Turns 19 and 21 ("Why do you not call ten a, like-- a" "an odd number A::ND a even number?"). Although she has generated the second example of an odd-and- even, her statement continues in the second person (you) and thus maintains the category and the example as his. In doing so, she completes the revoicing move by then opening the slot for Sean to confirm or disconfirm her reformulation. After a three-second pause in Turn 22, Sean politely (if a little falteringly) revises his position to include both ten and six in the category of odd-and-even numbers.p. 119continuous tone image 120 Accountable Argumentation Sean is active in the coconstruction of the odd-and-evens in this segment. From his position as principal, he asserts the boundaries of his category for six in Turn 18 by correcting Mei's restatement of his claim. By insisting that he is not claim- ing six is odd, but rather odd-and-even, he maintains the category of numbers under construction. Mei takes up the refined category in Turn 21 with an emphatic 'A::ND" linking the emphasized words odd and even, underscoring that they are indeed talking about the same kind of number. Sean thanks Mei for bringing up the example of ten (Turn 22), rejecting it as a counterexample and appropriating it as a second example using the resources of accountable argumentation. Accountable argumentation, with its expectation of modifying positions in light of convincing evidence, provides an interactional resource for Sean to "revise" his position without losing face (Renkema, 1993). He concedes to disagree with himself (Turn 20), revising his position, and allows ten as a second instance of an odd-and-even. Since he is still positioned to confirm or disconfirm this second reformulation, he maintains his role as principal of the controversy, as well as originator of the odd-and-even category. Accountable argumentation sequences are primarily managed by the students engaged in them. Although these episodes were selected for close analysis in part because of Ball's peripherality, Ball nonetheless plays an important role in their execution. Although she is peripheral to the interaction, Ball does two kinds of work in this segment, one visible and one invisible. The visible work she does is to help Mei maintain the floor. By asking Riba to watch Mei, Ball transfers her teacher's authority to Mei, supporting her authority to speak. The invisible work that Ball does in this segment is one of non-intervention, related to the norma- tive measured pace that supports accountable argumentation. Mei takes several pauses--one that lasts for 7 seconds (Turn 17)-while she is struggling to find her example of ten. Ball's silence and nonintervention allow Mei to do that chal- lenging mathematical work. Ball's choice of nonintervention during this 7-second pause is interesting to contrast with her decision to intervene after Sheena's 2-second pause in Episode 1. Recall that 2 seconds after Sheena starts to put the yardstick back in the tray, Ball steps in to close the argumentation sequence. During the pause in Episode 1, Sheena has signaled her readiness to relinquish her role as principal, whereas during Mei's 7-second pause, no such signal is provided. In fact, Ball has just signaled Riba to "watch what Mei is doing" recognizing that Mei is hard at work and should not be interrupted. This contrast highlights the subtle contextual cues that Ball relies on to support her students during accountable argumentation sequences. Discussion of Episode 2: Through her roles as clarifier and then as dissenter- reasoner, Mei helps to move Sean's statement about six from a particular claim about six to a general class of numbers. Although further work by other class par- ticipants generates other examples of odd-and-evens, eventually mapping them onto a pattern on the number-line pattern, Mei's strategy of empathic dissent con- tributes to the mathematization of Sean's original statement. Empathic dissent, inp. 120 ilana Seidel Horn 121 contradistinction with the cross-representational talk of Episode 1, proves to be mathematically productive here and later in the class session.6 Of course, Sean and Ball also contribute to the coconstruction of the concept during this episode, but Mei has done significant mathematical work. The transformations of the statement about six can be summarized in Figure 3.3. In this figure, some important statements that highlight the construction of a generalization from Episode 2 are placed in chronological order. Mei first clarifies Sean's original statement, in the leftmost box. Her summary, in the second box, highlights his focus on the odd number of groups of two. The third box contains one of Mei's dissenting statements. In objecting, she names the source of the dis- agreement as "the number of groups," a more general description of a "type" of number. The fourth box contains the second instance of odd-and-even numbers, generated as a counterexample by Mei from her position as a dissenter. The last box includes a statement that alerts the class to the possibility that even more ex- amples of such numbers may exist. Sean: S Mei: D Mei: D Mei: D Mei: Six can be an U I think what I It's not I Why do you I Why don't you odd and an M he's saying is S according S not call 10 a, S call other like even number.

Discussion Revisiting the questions Let us return to the questions that introduced this study: How can classroom discourse be organized to support mathematical disagreements that (a) are in- tellectually productive, and (b) minimize social discomfort? This analysis of the interactional organization of Deborah Ball's January 19, 1990, class provides one set of answers to those questions. In this classroom, accountable argumentation brings the often hidden practices of mathematical reasoning into the visible world of classroom interactions; it al- lows for students to productively engage with the discipline (Engle & Conant, 2002). However, accountable argumentation entails something subtler than an 6 Whether Episode 1 could have become mathematically productive is an open question. My hunch is that more common ground would need to be established between Sean and Sheena, perhaps through the intervention of a clarifier who could help them link the different inscriptions they were using.p. 121 122 Accountable Argumentation outright modeling of mathematical thinking. The social risks commonly associat- ed with disagreement manage to be mitigated by other elements of its structure. How does accountable argumentation make mathematical thinking a visible activity? First, the structure provided by accountable argumentation helps make disagreements intellectually productive in several ways: by providing support for thinking activities, by supporting deep engagement with specific ideas, and by supporting the learning and creating of new mathematics. Two norms of account- able argumentation, in particular, support thinking activities in the classroom: the use of terms from the mathematical and academic registers, such as proving and conjecturing, and the slow and measured pace of discussions that permit such activity to take place. During the class session, these thinking activities are focused on a particular set of ideas. Accountable argumentation supports engagement with specific ideas, particularly through the expectations that students attend to whole class discus- sions and students take a justified position in a discussion that they will act on or defend. In addition, once they are engaged in a disagreement, the stakes for engagement increase. Dissenters are obliged to ask questions or otherwise sub- stantiate their position to their peers. Principals, in contrast, must articulate their thinking to the whole class. Effectively, these thinking activities and the engagement in particular ideas sup- port both the learning and creation of mathematics. When Sheena has to articulate her position on zero, she transforms a vague statement to her teacher into a well- reasoned position to the whole class. This change can be viewed as increased com- petence and is indicative of her learning. Likewise, Sean "revises" his thinking about six as a unique "odd-and-even" number, recognizing that Mei's example of ten is also odd-and-even. He incorporates an example that had not been previously part of his thinking; he, too, has learned something new. Perhaps most striking, through the class' discussion, the particular observation about one number becomes the first of many examples of a general class of numbers-a counterexample is transformed into a second example through the process of argumentation, mirroring a way in which mathematics is created by mathematicians (Lakatos, 1976). How do Ball's students tolerate the tension that is usually associated with dis- agreement in our culture? The discourse of accountable argumentation consis- tently distinguishes it from potentially threatening, personal disputes. By couch- ing disagreements in academic terms, language provides not only a marker but a resource that allows students to challenge one another ("Prove it to us!"), make uncertain guesses (conjecture), and change their minds (revise) while avoiding the corresponding social costs of being deemed aggressive, foolish, or weak. Also, the deliberate civility of the exchanges (please, thank you) serves as a reminder that these arguments are not meant to be hostile. In addition, students sometimes deliberately disagree with positions ("what he said"), not people, again distanc- ing the intellectual from the personal. Finally, disagreements are often initiated in the third person, changing to second person only after the principals have ratified their position.p. 122 Rlana Seidel Horn 123 Accountable argumentation provides subtle resources to mediate these tensions. The normalization of disagreements seems to play a significant role in alleviating potential risks. The students appear to know the norms, expectations, language, and roles through which to argue. Ball, through her talk, underscores disagree- ment as a collective, not personally threatening, activity through her use of the first person plural ("we're probably not going to settle this"). By helping students focus on the substance of one another's reasoning, accountable argumentation supports student learning through disagreement. Limitations of this analysis: The importance of the teacher In this study, I bring to the foreground the (mostly) student-mediated disagree- ments in this class session. I focus my analysis on two disagreement episodes in which the students themselves primarily manage the interactions. This strategy relegates the teacher to the background, underplaying her role in establishing and maintaining sustainable accountable argumentation. Yet even from this distance, the teacher's work emerges; an observer would be making a grave mistake to think that the students on their own can manage these disagreements because of the participation structure itself. Within the disagreement episodes, the most obvious and ongoing pedagogical tension is whether the teacher should step in or stand back during students' dis- cussions. Although an observer can sense Ball's grappling with this issue (as in Line 26 of the transcript), the data give us limited access to her judgments here. Other data-especially her journals and writings (e.g., Ball, 1998)-reveal the range of contextual knowledge employed in making these decisions throughout the class session. These resources include, but are not limited to, her assessments of the utility of students' exchanges for the whole class's learning, her plans for the day, and her sense of the "sturdiness" of individual students in the face of disagreements. Furthermore, by focusing on one form of patterned interaction in the class's discourse, this analysis does not emphasize the many ways the teacher supports the viability of disagreements throughout the class session. First, in the strongly scaffolded disagreements that were not focused on here, Ball models the disagree- ment strategies explicated in this chapter by taking on roles, enacting norms, and using the academic registers and polite tones that she expects from her students. Even when she herself is not modeling argumentation practices, she exerts her authority from the sidelines of the student-student exchanges to assist them in sustaining their disagreements. She helps students maintain the conversational floor by focusing the audience's attention on their arguments. Even beyond all ar- gumentation, she attends to the socio-emotional experience of disagreeing when, at the end of this particularly intense class session, she debriefs with her students about their experience of the controversies. For example, she asks the students (including Sean) how it feels to be the only person taking a particular position. This aspect of the work of teaching mathematics through disagreements is notp. 123 124 Accountable Argumentation highlighted in this analysis. Although the analysis of accountable argumentation might provide a starting point for teachers wanting to engage in complex teach- ing practices by providing images of, and language for, how students might learn through disagreements, it does not do justice to the nuanced and difficult judg- ments a teacher makes while orchestrating such discussions.

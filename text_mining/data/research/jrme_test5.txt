The same in- structional moment cannot be recreated; each classroom conversation is different from the next. Given this natural predicament, the contributors to this monograph have pursued an enduring question: how can researchers portray classroom life in multiple ways so as to reveal the complexity of teaching to others? In fact, the authors aim to contribute to efforts that make knowledge useable to teachers. Just what is meant for research to generate knowledge that is useable for teachers' everyday instructional practice? I found Lewis's elaboration helpful, and one that I draw on as I compare the chapters. Specifically, these chapters were brought together in the hopes of- 1. informing teachers as they engage in daily work in the classroom, 2. informing researchers on the complex work that is teaching, by expressing different analytic perspectives, and 3. creating opportunities for the reader to better understand those analytic per- spectives themselves by comparing them. After reading and rereading these chapters carefully, I considered how they viewed classroom life by comparing their analytic lenses. In making sense of the chapters, I turned to what Goodwin (1984) wrote about professional vision. He posits that professional vision consists of three practices: 1. Coding, which transforms phenomena observed in a specific setting into the objects of knowledge that animate the discourse of a profession 2. Highlighting, which makes specific phenomena in a complex perceptual field salient by marking them in some fashion 3. Producing and articulating material representations. By applying these practices to scrutinized phenomena, participants build and contest professional vision, which consists of socially organized ways of seeingp. [173] 174 Commentary1: Generating Useable Knowledge for Teaching and understanding events that are answerable to the distinctive interests of a par- ticular social group (p. 606). Although individuals working within the same profession wrote the chapters in this volume, I found that Goodwin's conception of professional vision was useful in thinking about how the chapters generated different interpretations of the same instance of classroom practice. Each chapter-in its own way-created coding schemes, highlighting various aspects of the talk to allow us to see what was happening interactionally between the teacher and students in the same 6-minute episode. In so doing, they all tried to bring some coherence to the classroom events, preserved for us through videotape. From such coding and highlighting, they produced conceptual frameworks, inviting the reader to understand the sense they made of Ball's teaching moves and her students' participation. The chapters each attempted to uncover underlying structures, principles, and interactional patterns that governed what happened. For Ball, Lewis, and Hoover (chapter 1), the governing factor is the structure of teaching that lies behind stu- dents' mathematical talk. For Schoenfeld (chapter 2), it is the principled way that a teacher makes decisions while engaged in the act of teaching. For Horn (chapter 3), it is a participant structure that allows for mathematically productive argumen- tation. For Posner (chapter 4), it is interactional patterns that raise concerns about equity and the opportunity to engage in authentic mathematical practices. I com- pare these frameworks to reveal how the collected analyses help us see more than any one on its own. I articulate where the analyses disagree, and consider whether the disagreements are resolvable. I end with questions that this monograph raises for our continued efforts to produce analyses that are useable for teaching. COMPARING ANALYTIC VIEWS Following Goodwin, "my own practices of seeing" are naturally part of my at- tempts to make sense of these chapters collectively. In an attempt to answer how the multiple views deepen our understandings at the same time that they reveal different things, I created a side-by-side chart on which I took notes on the ana- lytic frame and claims each chapter made, line by line across the entire transcript. Using that representation, I made meta-comments about the frameworks that the chapters used to explain the line-by-line analysis. I then looked for convergence and divergence across the analyses and made my own interpretations about the effects of these similarities and differences on our understanding of the work of teaching and the work of research on teaching. Two episodes within the 6 minutes emerged as common comparison points across the chapters. The first episode was the exchange between Sheena and Shea (S/S) at the very beginning of the transcript. The second was the extended ex- change among Nathan, Betsy and others (N/B) about his statements regarding even numbers. Those two episodes allowed me to make a side-by-side comparison and helped me think about how these analyses made our understanding of the work of teaching more visible. In this commentary, I use those episodes to talkp. 174 Elham Kazemi 175 about the analytic perspectives themselves in how the authors coded, highlighted, and produced representations of what happened during the episodes. Ball aims to help students develop mathematical knowledge through mathemati- cal reasoning. She cultivates mathematical reasoning through the resources that be- come available as the teacher and children participate in public discussions. Those ideas reflect and express certain cognitive values. Goodnow (1990) writes that- cognitive development is marked by the acquisition of values. We do not simply learn to solve problems. We learn also what problems are considered worth solv- ing, and what counts as an elegant rather than simply an acceptable solution. We do not simply acquire knowledge. We learn also that some particular pieces of knowledge are expected of us, that some can be happily ignored and that some are inappropriate for all but a few to own.... Finally, we learn that some ways of acquiring knowledge are more acceptable than others, and that particular ways of seeking are expected for particular areas of knowledge (pp. 259-260). In Ball's vision of teaching, students must learn to engage with one another. Many may agree that making mathematical claims and producing mathemati- cal arguments is an important aspect of mathematical practice. Central to Ball's teaching goals is that the "public testing [emphasis added] of ideas is crucial to doing and learning mathematics" (Ball et al., chapter 1, p. 31 ]). These analyses all hinge on this important dimension of Ball's teaching-that students are being en- couraged to engage in mathematical argumentation with one another Moreover, Ball aims to teach her students how to express their ideas, listen to one another, agree, disagree, and build on one another's ideas, all in a respectful manner. Ball and her colleagues underscore the fact that the three practices that make up their framework are in the service of drawing students into mathematical reasoning. Other terms and phrases, used across the chapters, bring further contours to what is meant by engaging in argumentation. In Schoenfeld's (chapter 2) state- ments about Ball's knowledge and beliefs, we see such terms as clarify, elaborate, extend, justify, and make clear arguments. In Horn (chapter 3), such terms and phrases as agree, disagree, justified position, and act on or defend a position all highlight the cognitive values that the teacher aims to cultivate in this classroom. Considering Schoenfeld's and Ball and colleagues 'frameworks. In the Sean/ Sheena (S/S) exchange, Schoenfeld's (chapter 2) analysis helps us see how a pre- dictable but flexible routine, initiated when the teacher asks the students to discuss a topic, underlies Ball's decision making. We see that a deep structure is evident in the way that students' claims are brought out for public consideration. Clearly, the routine has many decision points, which create many complex manifestations of how any particular discussion could unfold. Schoenfeld shows that the S/S ex- change involves two cycles through the routine, and that the exchange with Nathan (lines 24-58) involves one cycle through the routine. According to Schoenfeld's modeling, how Ball navigates through these particular exchanges is understood through extensive consideration of the knowledge, beliefs, and goals that both buttress her teaching and become differentially activated during it. For example, when Sheena offered her first comment about the meeting, it warranted first beingp. 175 176 Commentary 1: Generating Useable Knowledge for Teaching clarifiedand then being abstracted and reframed by Ball: "So you thought about something that came up in the meeting that you hadn't thought about before?" (line 7). The second cycle through the routine begins when Sean responded to the teacher's request for more comments about the meeting. This time, because Sheena asked right away for Sean to repeat what he said (thereby making the re- quest for clarification), the teacher monitored the exchange between them because it fit within her goals and beliefs about what should be pursued. After listening and monitoring, Ball stepped in (line 20) to diffuse the tension created by Sean and Sheena's two ways of defining even to affirm that much disagreement still existed and that it was okay for Sean and Sheena to experience this disagreement. Although Schoenfeld's model is not a script, it fosters an understanding of the pathways Ball could use to navigate through any discussion. Ball and her colleagues' (chapter 1) central concern is with how the teacher "read[ies] mathematical content so that students can engage in it ... and readies students to be doers and learners of mathematics" (chapter 1, p. 40). They posit that three related practices draw students into learning mathematical reasoning: naming, making claims, and evaluating mathematical claims. In both the S/S and N/B exchanges, they show us how participating in these practices plays out, pay- ing specific attention to the way the teacher configures talk to engage students in those practices. I am thinking here, for example, how the analysis has us consider the way the teacher framed the question for discussion to convey the idea that do- ing mathematics is about exchanging and testing ideas. Ball asked her students to offer "comments" about the "meeting," and "listen to one another's comments, so that we can um, benefit from what other people say" (line 1). The phrasing of the request itself conveys to students the importance of hearing different ideas, ready- ing them to engage in mathematical work. Both Schoenfeld's and Ball and colleagues' analyses help us notice that the teacher works to clarify students' comments or prompt students to elaborate their thinking. Ball's responses to Sheena help her "understand and perform the work of 'making a comment'" (chapter 1, p. 24). Ball's prompting allows Sheena to specify the mathematical idea that she considered during the meeting with the fourth grad- ers, and these more specific ideas, now made public, give more mathematical grist for the class to think about. Later, in the exchange with Nathan, Ball and coauthors' analysis again shows us that the teacher's questioning of Nathan is an example of Ball's putting a more formal mathematical idea about the sums of even numbers into language accessible to children, "when you put even numbers together, you get an even number" (line 26). Further, their attention to the practice of evaluat- ing assertions allows us to see that in the N/B exchange, Betsy and others used counterexamples and raised questions about whether the claim works in general in the process of both clarifying Nathan's claim and evaluating its plausibility. Listening to students' ideas brings with it a host of teaching questions. One set of questions centers on what teachers should do when students offer ideas. What should be pursued and when? Schoenfeld's analysis of why Ball did not intervene helps us consider that it is related to her goals of(a) allowing students to probe onep. 176 Elham Kazemi 177 another's ideas with respect and (b) encouraging students to think on their own. We also read in a number of chapters that Ball was hoping to engage the students in a meta-level conversation about the experience of having a meeting with anoth- er group to listen to others' ideas about mathematical issues that were perplexing them. All the chapters point out that one of the reasons the exchange between Sean and Sheena ends unresolved was that they are using different definitions of even. Because Ball has a complex set of goals, all of them cannot be highly activated at once. She decides to help diffuse some of the tension but attempts to return the students to thinking about the meeting. We also know that Ball was thinking about having students consider, later in the lesson, a set of related conjectures about what happens when two even numbers are added. Ball and her colleagues and Schoenfeld offer that her listening and monitoring were also contributing to her own learning. The exchange they use to make this point is Ball's question to Nathan about his statements (line 26). I see this idea about teacher learning as being relevant to the S/S exchange as well because Ball could have been learning about what happens when students use different definitions during a mathematical argument. Whether Ball did or did not recognize the definitional dispute on the spot, the problem raises questions that are worthy of deliberation: how does the teacher help students reconcile and use different definitions in argumentation? How might definitional differences lead to disputes that are dead ends? When might such differences be generative? How might the teacher decide whether the class has the interactional resources and foundational knowledge to pursue particular disagreements? Studying those ques- tions as they unfold in classroom discussions would add to the kind of useable knowledge that research could produce. Layering on Horn's analysis. When I layered on Horn's (chapter 3) analysis of the S/S exchange, I saw the following relationship. Both Ball and colleagues' and Horn's frameworks focus on argumentation and how mathematical reasoning is supported in the classroom. Ball and coauthors identified practices-naming and using names, making claims, evaluating mathematical assertions-that pervade classroom talk. Horn's accountable argumentation could be thought of as a way these practices come together in an argumentation sequence when the practices of making claims and evaluating assertions lead to generative mathematical activity. Horn's analysis includes attention to the particular kinds of roles that students take on as they engage in argumentation. In the instance of the S/S exchange, the disagreement came to an impasse when the differing definitions and claims made by Sean and Sheena were not themselves examined and reconciled. Although not discussed in detail in Horn's chapter, the N/B exchange (lines 45- 58) is coded as another example of accountable argumentation; in that exchange, Betsy acts as the initiator of the argumentation sequence, and Nathan acts as the principal. Betsy's question and statements (line 48: You need three twos to make six. You can't put a four and a four or a ...") serve to counter one version of the claim she thought Nathan made. This statement invites a response from Nathan top. 177 178 Commentary 1: Generating Useable Knowledge for Teaching explain his idea further and from Betsy to acknowledge that she understands what he was trying to say: "So what you're doing isyou're going by twos and then what two equals from then you go from-all the way up" (line 55). Betsy plays both the role of dissenter and that of clarifier in this short exchange, moving in fact from dissenter to ally once Nathan's statements are clarified. Nathan confirms that he was heard and says, "Yeah, I'm not going by every single number" (line 52). Ball and colleagues' claim is that students were able to engage in reasoning about claims publicly because they had learned to listen to, clarify, and evaluate one an- other's claims. The students take many turns without explicit teacher intervention, but again Ball and coauthors' chapter helps us see that the teacher was proactive in readying students for such work by focusing their attention on one another, re- stating claims for students to think about, and modeling ways of engaging with one another respectfully. Horn's description of accountable argumentation allows us to see that students must take on particular roles to accomplish such collective exchanges in which claims are evaluated. Melding Ball and colleagues' perspec- tives with Horn's, these roles, once recognized, might be explicitly cultivated by the teacher through talk as she readies students to engage in mathematics. Bringing Posner's analysis into consideration. One idea that appears consis- tently in the chapters in this monograph is that agreeing and disagreeing publicly tend to bring to the fore a range of personal, social, and mathematical tensions. Ball and colleagues (chapter 1) state that the practices they define in their frame- work "provide ways to focus on who talks, what gets talked about, and how it gets talked about" (chapter 1, p. 41). This particular sentence resonated quite strongly for me when I read Posner's (chapter 4) analysis of the equity issues that are raised when studying the interactional patterns underlying classroom talk. Posner's chapter, in this collection, is designated as the chapter on equity. We must take care, though, not to brand the other chapters as not concerned with equity. In fact, concern with equity-with how students are respected and heard in the classroom-is present in all the chapters. Ball and coauthors refer repeat- edly to the importance of all students' being engaged in the practices they iden- tify in their framework. Schoenfeld articulates one of Ball's central goals for the classroom community as being that all students feel "enfranchised in the class- room community, free to express themselves" (chapter 2, p. 96). This goal comes into focus when making sense of Ball's decision making. Horn too proposes her framework for accountable argumentation with a concern about how argumenta- tion sequences unfold so that they are socially viable, without discernable nega- tive consequences for participants. Through that lens, Ball and her colleagues show that students made many more claims than the teacher; and they, along with Horn, show that repeated sustained interactions occurred between students as they worked through mathematical issues. Yet what Posner helps the reader see is quite different. Through Posner's coding and highlighting, we have an opportunity to think specifically about how students perform and are designed into roles that render their contributions to be of lower status and perhaps less visible than oth-p. 178 Elham Kazemi 179 ers. Her analytic lens makes us think about how we know discussions are socially viable and whether all students are enfranchised. Posner's analysis of the S/S exchange. Posner's (chapter 4) analysis of the S/S exchange has us consider the way Sheena and Sean positioned one another. As mentioned previously, all the chapters agree that this particular exchange ended with a dispute because Sheena and Sean were arguing on the basis of different def- initions of even. Posner goes further to argue that the disagreement also revealed power differentials that are particularly alarming given that the exchange was be- tween an African American girl and a white boy. Unlike the authors of the other chapters, she raises the possibility that Sheena's halting speech, her invocation of the fourth grader's arguments, and so on, all amount to conveying a reluctance to take a stand and be responsible for her position in the face of Sean's question- ing. Sheena failed even to use her own understanding of the "two things make it" definition of even, which in fact was the current working definition for the entire class. And Posner has us consider whether Sean's move to engage Sheena with the statement "You said it was" (line 19) changed the nature of the disagreement from a conceptual to an interpersonal one. Posner uses additional data from the data corpus (beyond what is available in the 6-minute episode) to provide support for this position. What enables Posner to see and make this argument? Her analytic views are guided by science studies, about how in the authentic practice of science, credit is given to individuals at the same time that it renders invisible others who contrib- uted to a scientific development. She also draws on practice theory, which attends to the dialectic relationship between individual actions and social structures, thus coming to these transcripts with an eye to examining how everyday interactions produce and reproduce existing social structures that give differential power to groups in our society on the bases of race, class, and gender. Posner's analysis of the N/B exchange. Posner's (chapter 4) analysis of the N/B exchange also departs markedly from the others. In the exchange with Nathan, she considers that part of the misunderstanding that was created when Nathan began talking might have resulted from confusing the everyday understanding of even as meaning "equal" with the property of numbers that the students were discussing. She makes this hypothesis after observing that Ball had noticed that confusion in his work. No one can say for certain whether Nathan was experiencing this confusion during the episode, but the larger point that teachers must develop keen insight into the relationship between students' everyday and mathematical under- standings is important. Ball (1997) herself talks about the importance of attending to this idea, writing about how teachers' on-the-spot interpretations can miss what students are actually saying (we see evidence of this phenomenon in the transcript, in line 60-65, as well when Ball realizes that Sean has made a new conjecture only after Mei says she knows what Sean is talking about). A statement from a stu- dent that might seem confusing or completely disjointed may often have a certain logic behind it. One of the advantages of research is that it provides the time andp. 179 180 Commentary 1: Generating Useable Knowledge for Teaching opportunity for reflecting on classroom actions, which fly by at breakneck speed during class time. Such work can inform teachers in their efforts to better hear their students and consider the possibilities of how students' everyday understand- ings influence their emerging mathematical understandings. Sheena s and Sean s contributions to class. One important limitation I see in Posner's (chapter 4) claims is whether Sheena's backing down in the moment, an African American girl to a white male, was related to a systematic pattern of backing down in the classroom in other circumstances, either by her or by others, along racial, class, or gender lines. From Ball and colleagues' chapter, we have a different view of what Ball does to support Sheena to make a statement that is publicly available for evaluation by the class. Ball and coauthors show the teacher prompting Sheena to make a more specific assertion about what she gained from the meeting (lines 2 through 7). They interpret Ball's moves as helping Sheena learn what it means to make a comment. As a reader, Posner's analysis of Sheena provoked other important questions for me about other students in the class. For example, what are the differences in how Mei and Sheena talked? Mei, it seems, did not back down. How should we understand Mei's positioning in the classroom and the factors that enabled her to display competence confidently? Using data from Ball's teacher logs, Posner claims that Sean was also unsure of his ideas and confused definitions on more than one occasion. His idea about even and odd numbers ultimately got much play in the classroom, and the teacher's identification of his insight into a class of numbers called "Sean numbers" ac- corded it further status and play. I wonder how multiple perspectives on Sean, in relation to the class, would help us think about his contribution and the way it was highlighted in the class. Within race and gender, further class and linguistic differences can also be considered. In addition, knowing children's peer status and friendships would be greatly useful in this analysis, although this kind of data was not available to the authors here. To perceive Sean as the archetypical white male who gets all the attention would not be wise, nor would teachers' leaving this analysis thinking that all white males need to be curtailed in their contributions to class. The work on identity tells us that identities are fluid and changing, that children live and act across boundaries of many different groups and situations (Holland et al., 1998; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Sfard & Prusak, 2005). Would our analysis differ if we knew that Sean, for example, was the least popular child in the class or a child with high-functioning autism, and that the move to pay atten- tion to his ideas made his thinking visible and allowed him to display competence in a way that improved his social status or made him better able to consider other people's point of view? Would our perception differ if we saw changes over time in Sheena's ability to articulate her position and not back down when challenged? Do children in this class engage differently when they are newcomers to the school versus old-timers? The consequences of naming "Sean's numbers." The practice of naming ideas after particular students is something I have seen many teachers use (and which Ip. 180 Elham Kazemi 181 use as well). As a strategy is shared, a teacher or even children might start refer- ring to it by using a classmate's name, "Darlene's arrow method," for example. If thought about in relation to the norm of creating a base of public knowledge in the classroom, such practices can be quite useful because they enable the class to refer back to particular ideas; once named and defined, ideas can be carried across to other lessons and be connected to one another. Posner's (chapter 4) analysis of the events that led Ball to label all numbers having the property that Sean first noticed about six-a property that every other even number has-as "Sean numbers" calls this practice into question. Posner suggests that it is not a neutral activity but may have rendered invisible the contributions of Mei and Riba in producing the gen- eralization. We see the class refer to other ideas by similar labels: Sheena's work- ing definition of even, Ofala's definition of odd, for example. Should these kinds of labels always be questioned? Sheena's definition, we learn, was also modified by Mei, who often contributed to class discussions (something we learn across Ball's other papers; see, for example, Ball, 1997). But Posner does not specifically suggest that it too should have been named for Mei and Sheena. Naming, in Ball and colleagues' (chapter 1) framework, is an important dimension of mathemati- cal practice, and thus a crucial consideration for future research and discussion among educators and researchers is how the generation of class-derived labels (named after particular students) reflects messages about who is competent in mathematics. Posner's critique of the practice of naming ideas after students opens up much for us to consider. The role of equity across analytic views. My attempts to make sense of the four analytic frames led to me other questions about the role equity plays in the ana- lytic lenses used across the four chapters. Should every analytic framework con- sider who participates and how, or is the lesson from these analyses that the ability to layer analytic views is of utmost importance in allowing us to see teaching and produce useable knowledge? What I am asking is whether Ball and colleagues' framework should or could be expanded to pay particular attention to who, in what way, and how often students and the teacher make and evaluate claims? Could Schoenfeld's model include in the teacher's decision making more explicit consid- eration of what the teacher knows about students' ways of engaging and concerns about students' status and position? Might Horn's framework attend to whether patterns are evident in the kinds of roles students play in classroom discussions and whether those roles contribute to status differences? SUMMARY AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS As one way of summarizing my analysis of these chapters' contributions to a multilayered view of teaching, let me state the considerations about teaching that the chapters invited us to see. These chapters have contributed to the following complex view of teaching and the resources that became available for learning as Ball aimed to engage her students in mathematical argumentation:p. 181 182 Commentary 1: Generating Useable Knowledge for Teaching 1. Ball and colleagues' (chapter 1) practices of naming, making claims, and evaluating assertions help us see the mathematical activity that underlies the teacher's and students' public contributions to discussions. 2. Schoenfeld's (chapter 2) routine conveys how ideas enter into public con- sideration. The routine for discussing a topic makes Ball's decision making visible and predictable rather than ephemeral and unattainable as acts of a gifted teacher. 3. Horn's (chapter 3) accountable argumentation structure allows us to consider how mathematical reasoning is supported by the roles teachers and students play when public disagreement arises over a mathematical assertion. The discourse structure is a way to think about the trajectory of a discussion, whether and how it is both socially viable and mathematically productive. 4. Posner's (chapter 4) attention to equity issues leads us to further consider the impact of students' positioning in discussions-how students' contributions are heard, considered, and affirmed by the class and by the teacher. Each of these major analytic views is directly related to the work of teaching, when the aim is to make mathematical argumentation a collective enterprise. One productive avenue for further collaboration and analysis is to explore whether these analytic views can be considered together-can researchers themselves model how to do so? What additional work might we do to create a unifying framework that allows us to consider these major views? What would constitute such a framework? Perhaps, like Rogoff's (2003) theory of human development, we may find that the frameworks can be brought together by thinking about the various planes of analysis and what comes into focus within each plane. Whatever the product, the field of teaching and learning would be advanced by such syn- thetic work. This monograph also inspires much other research related to the cultivation of classroom communities. The chapters point to the fact that by January the teacher has done much work that enables the students to engage in argumenta- tion. Teachers and researchers will surely want to know the kind of work teachers have to do to make that environment possible. Creating discussion-intensive class- rooms in which argumentation is fostered produces its own inherent complexities. How do students learn to agree and disagree? How much do they contribute, and how are ideas taken up by the group? What are the social relations among chil- dren? Posner emphasizes race and gender in her discussion of equity issues that undergird the talk in the 6-minute segment. Issues of class and linguistic compe- tence should be considered. If one thinks about accountable argumentation as a particular structure-and agrees that it could be mathematically generative-then how does one think about setting it up? When does it become socially viable, and when not? How can teachers be attuned to the way students' participation in classrooms reproduces broader social inequities that divide us along racial, class, and gender lines? How does one think about whether something is mathematically productive? A consideration of those factors would fit with Schoenfeld's idea thatp. 182 Elham Kazemi 183 his decision-making model can become a source of serious consideration among teachers-what decisions could they have made, and why? Although understandably limited by the data set, students' own experiences of these events, nevertheless, are absent. Many claims are made in these chapters about what students are learning and what kinds of selves are being developed. The students' own perspectives are missing. What is being a newcomer in this class- room like? What is developing competence in English like in such a discussion- intensive classroom? What happens to students who do not like to talk publicly in such classrooms? What happens to friendship patterns when students agree and disagree with one another? As we continue to investigate the teacher's role in classroom discussions, we must include students' own interpretation of classroom events. Such data will surely complicate our own data collection and analytic pro- cedures, but these complications would also enrich our understandings. As I read and thought about the chapters in this monograph I was reminded again and again of Paley's (1986) words in her essay on the importance of listen- ing to children's ideas: It is curiosity, not answers, that we model. As we seek to learn more about a child, we demonstrate the acts of observing, listening, questioning, and wonder- ing. When we are curious about a child's words and our responses to those words, the child feels respected. The child is respected. "What are these ideas I have that are so interesting to the teacher? I must be somebody with good ideas" (p. 127). The chapters in this monograph show deep respect for teachers, teaching, and children. They provoke a lot of serious thinking about what children and teachers do, what kinds of understanding and values are expressed and cultivated through teaching. And they demonstrate a deep commitment to taking the work of children and teachers seriously. Coming together to focus on a tiny slice of life in a class- room, these chapters show collectively how much we can learn about teaching as they point simultaneously to the work we still must do.
